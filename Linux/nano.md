# Nano

`nano` is a simple editor. 

If you need minimal work in a text editor in Linux - `nano` is an excellent choice for beginners without a lot of learning curve. For unix-based systems, it is already installed. This is for recent versions of nano.
Enjoy...

## First step of nano:
To just open a nano instance without having a file in mind:
- In the terminal, write `nano`
- Then write something
- Press `ctrl + o` or `ctrl + s` to save and write the desired NAME of the FILE.
- Press `ctrl + x` to exit.

If you want to open a file some/path/abc.txt, and change it:
- In the terminal, write `nano some/path/abc.txt`
- Then write/change something
- `ctrl + o` or `ctrl + s` to save (same file name)
- `ctrl + x` to exit

You can press `ctrl + x` without the saving `ctrl + s` as well. In that case, nano will ask you `Save modified buffer?` with the opotions `Y - yes`, `N - no`, `ctrl + c - cancel`.
Then you can press `Y` to save the file (or `N` not to save it and exit or `ctrl + c` to go back to the editing phase without exiting.) 


#### Tips
Most of the shortcuts are already written when you enter nano at the bottom.
- ^ usually means ctrl
- M usually means alt
- use `Ctrl+G` or `F1` for help


## Other common commands (tried to write more common functions first):
- Find: `Ctrl + W`
- Replace: `Ctrl + \`
- Cut a line (or marked region): `Ctrl + K`
- paste cut-buffer: `Ctrl + U`
- Undo: `alt + U`
- Redo: `Alt + E`
- Movecursor through words/paragraphs at once: `Ctrl + arrow keys`
- Comment/Uncomment the line/marked selection: `Alt+ 3`
- If multiple files are open (for example, using `nano abc.txt bcd.py cde.R`), switch between buffers: `Alt + left/right arrow`
- Soft wrap: `Alt + S`
- Delete word to the left: `Alt + Backspace`
- Delete word to the right: `ctrl + delete`
- Complete current word: `ctrl + ]`
- Copy a line (or marked region): `Alt + 6`
- Go to complementary bracket: `Alt + ]`
- Report cursor position: `ctrl + c`

## Intermediate things:
#### File browser:
When in the Read-File (`Ctrl + R`) or Write-Out menu (`Ctrl + O`), pressing (`ctrl + t`) will invoke the file browser. 
Here, one can navigate directories in a graphical manner in order to find the desired file.


#### Execute bash commands:
Suppose you want to put the output of some bash command (e.g., `date`) in the current line. You can execute the command by:
- `ctrl + t`
- Type your command (such as `date` or `ls` etc)
- enter
Voila!

#### nanorc and Color schemes
The nanorc file consists of the modifiable settings of nano, including colors corresponding to filetypes. Some common color schemes are already in your `/usr/share/nano/` folder and you might have to load them (by `include "/usr/share/nano/nanorc.nanorc"`, `include "/usr/share/nano/c.nanorc"` etc.) Usually your nanorc is either in home directory or in `~/.config/nano/`

My complete nanorc, nanorc for R and matlab (for color scheme) is attached later

## All numbers:

## String highlighting.  You will in general want your comments and

## applied in the order they are read in.

## This string is VERY resource intensive!
