*** **This is realtively advanced feature to divide and conquor a terminal. It is especially useful if you are working inside an ssh session and you need another terminal/pane** 

We will mostly work with terminal splits. 

There are huge changes in tmux from version to version. I will try to stick to the latest version. 



## Tricks: 

Can't copy from just one block?
With tmux 1.8+, do `prefix-z` too zoom a specific pane, copy it, then do `prefix-z` to come back to original panes.
