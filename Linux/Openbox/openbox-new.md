Openbox is a stacking window manager (as opposed to tiling window manager).
Basically it can used as a very fast alternative to desktop environments like gnome/KDE/Deepin etc.
However, basic openbox needs more configuration to look pretty. 


This adds openbox new ideas and configuration assuming you already have another distro.
