Git is a "free ... distributed version control system ... to handle ... small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."

Basically, you don't have to rename your poject as "project(copy)(new)final-2.tex" etc etc etc. You can handle these kinds of stuff more easily. 

Moreover, many people can add soemthing into a project in an easy way. 


## Main commands of git:

#### Configure/Setup (one-time)
```bash
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
git config --global push.default simple
```
For authentication, it is easiest to use `ssh` or `secure shell` [See this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)


To initialize a git repo(sitory), you may do:
```bash
git init <directory>
```

To clone some existing repo in say `github`, you can do something like:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:<username>/<repo>.git
```



#### Main workflow of git:
- To update your local repository 
```bash 
git pull
```
- To add something/to stage changes for commiting: 
```bash 
git add <filename>
```
- To commit changes: 
```bash
git commit -m "message"
```
- To push these changes to the remote repository:
```bash
git push
```

To check the current changes after adding a file etc, use:
```bash
git status
```
To see the exact differences in the file:
```bash
git diff
```

## Terminology:
 - *local repository* -- repository in your local machine.
 - *remote/upstream repo(sitory)* -- If you store your project into some online repository (like github/gitlab/bitbucket) privately or publicly - this is where you store it. 
 - *branch* -- Your git repo(sitory) can have morre than one branch - maybe one for final product, maybe one for development type 1, one for development type 2 etc. You can copy/merge one branche('s) file to another. So you can experiment in *dev branch*, then merge it to the *master* branch.
 - *commit* (as verb) -- 'The action of storing a new snapshot of the projectâ€™s state in the Git history, by creating a new commit representing the current state of the index and advancing HEAD to point at the new commit.'
 - *Tracked and untracked files* - files either in the index cache or not yet added to it
 - *Cache* - a space intended to temporarily store uncommitted changes
 - *Stash* - another cache, that acts as a stack, where changes can be stored without committing them





## Specific commands needed:


#### Git diff:


To get the diff for the Staged file (after git add . or equaivalent)
```bash
git diff --staged
```



#### diff among branches:
```bash
git diff branch_1...branch_2
```

Get differences of two specific files:
```bash
git diff branch_1..branch_2 -- path/to/myfile
# or
git diff branch_1 branch_2 -- path/to/myfile
```

Only to know which files differ:
```bash
git diff --name-only branch_1...branch_2
```

Compare checked out branch to branch_2
```bash
git diff ..branch_2
```

#### Checkout one file from another branch

syntax:
```bash
git checkout branch_name -- file_name
```
e.g.:
```bash
git checkout master               # first get back to master
git checkout dev -- app.js	  # then copy the version of app.js from branch "dev"
```
Or Update August 2019, Git 2.23
With the new git switch and git restore commands, that would be:
```bash
git switch master
git restore --source dev -- app.js
```
